# workout-plan-generator
A very simple tool to generate a plaintext (.txt) workout plan and a checklist for checking off each day.

Currently just generates the checklist and assumes that you want it done 2 weeks at a time.

I made this for personal use so you can use it if you want but if you need something fixed you can either do it yourself, wait, or negotiate it with me.
